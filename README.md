# SD-Model-Relationships

Goal for this repo is to begin listing out all known Stable-Diffusion Models, how they were trained, and what models were they based on or merged from.
Eventually would like to see this as a large graph showing the ancestry of models.

May eventually replace with squlite database. ODS is here for quick prototyping. 


Feel free to add an issue to add/remove fields, or fork and create a PR to add models. Completly open to feedback.
